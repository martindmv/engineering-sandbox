# Engineering Sandbox

This repository is about creating an environment for EPF students to try out GitHub features alongside engineering skills, planning and designing on one hand and collaborating and solving technical issues together on the other hand.

## Skills

- **Methodological rigor**: planning and scoping to deliver on commitments
- **Technical collaboration**: building and maintaining a system collectively

### Methodological rigor

Includes: planning & estimation, documentation structure, ticket management, data quality & specifications, scope management, output vs outcome, quality standards

**Essence**: Know how to estimate (×2 +10%), structure work (Why/What/How/When), define realistic scope, aim for impact (outcome) rather than production (output), and maintain professional quality standards.

### Technical collaboration

Includes: efficiency vs effectiveness, technical documentation & architecture, GitHub & version control, collective code ownership, centralization vs fragmentation, tool mastery, architecture & technical debt, review & team blocking

**Essence**: Work as a team on shared codebase (Git/PRs), create documented and maintainable architecture, depersonalize code, avoid fragmentation, master collaborative tools, manage technical debt.

## Evaluation grid

| | | Resit À reprendre | Needs Work À travailler | Basic Bases | Solid Solide | Outstanding Remarquable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning and scoping to deliver on commitments | Expectations Attentes | Student cannot estimate realistic task durations or define achievable project scope. No planning structure visible. | Student creates basic planning (Gantt/Trello) but estimates are unrealistic (no ×2 +10% buffer). Scope is poorly defined or changes constantly without client alignment. | Student creates structured planning with realistic estimates (×2 +10% applied). Tickets follow Why/What/How/When structure. Scope is defined but may drift without proper tracking. | Student maintains accurate planning throughout project. Adjusts estimates based on reality. Scope changes are documented and validated with the fictive client. Focuses on outcomes rather than just outputs. | All the above + Student proactively identifies risks in planning, communicates scope trade-offs transparently, maintains professional quality standards (documentation, no typos in client materials), and delivers on commitments consistently. |
| | Observables (Realized / Not realized) Critères observables (Atteint / Non atteint) | No planning tool used or visible. Lab deadlines missed without communication. Autonomy work lacks defined objectives. | Planning tool (Kanban) created but not maintained. Large gaps between planned and actual dates. Lab deliverables incomplete or missing key specifications. | Planning tool used with structured tickets. Estimates documented. Labs completed with defined scope. Autonomy work has clear objectives and deliverables defined upfront. | Planning updated regularly. Fictive client validation obtained for scope changes. All labs delivered on time with quality documentation. Autonomy work demonstrates outcome focus. | All the above + Planning shows risk mitigation. Fictive client materials are polished (no typos, professional language). Transparency on difficulties documented. Autonomy work exceeds expectations with measurable impact. |

| | | Resit À reprendre | Needs Work À travailler | Basic Bases | Solid Solide | Outstanding Remarquable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Building and maintaining a system collectively | Expectations Attentes | Student works in isolation without version control or code reviews. No collaborative development practices visible. | Student uses Git but with poor practices (working on main, no PRs, merge conflicts). Code is personalized and difficult for others to modify. Documentation minimal or absent. | Student uses Git with branches and basic PRs. Code is somewhat documented. Participates in code reviews but may block team progress by being the sole reviewer. Basic architecture understanding. | Student uses Git effectively with clean PRs and timely reviews. Code ownership is collective (depersonalized). Technical documentation maintained. Architecture decisions are discussed and documented. Technical debt identified. | All the above + Student proactively improves architecture, manages technical debt strategically, unblocks teammates through collaborative reviews, masters collaborative tools (GitHub/CI/CD), and creates maintainable, well-documented systems. |
| | Observables (Realized / Not realized)
Critères observables (Atteint / Non atteint) | No Git repository or only local work. No evidence of collaboration. Code not shared or inaccessible to team. | Git used but frequent merge conflicts. PRs rare or non-existent. Code reviews absent. README outdated or missing. Personal coding style prevents collaboration. | Regular commits with branches. PRs created and merged. Basic code reviews conducted. README exists with setup instructions. Can work on others' code with guidance. | Clean Git history with meaningful commits. PRs reviewed by multiple people. Technical documentation updated. Architecture diagrams or decisions documented. Reviews don't block team. Tests written before merging. | All the above + Architecture refactoring documented. Technical debt tracked and addressed. Collaborative tools mastered (CI/CD pipelines, automated tests). Code quality standards enforced. Team unblocked through proactive reviews and pair programming. |
